  <h1>voice actor/ actor: David Tennant</h1>
    <p>In the 2017 reboot of "DuckTales," David Tennant voices the iconic character Scrooge McDuck. Scrooge is the adventurous and incredibly wealthy Scottish duck who is always on the lookout for new treasures and mysteries to solve. Tennant's portrayal brings a fresh yet faithful interpretation to the character, blending Scrooge's characteristic gruffness and toughness with a layer of warmth and depth that underscores his role as the head of the McDuck family.

        Tennant, known for his previous roles as the Tenth Doctor in "Doctor Who" and Kilgrave in "Jessica Jones," brings his distinct energy and charisma to Scrooge McDuck. His Scottish accent adds authenticity and a charming flair to the character, paying homage to Scrooge's origins while appealing to contemporary audiences.

        Throughout the series, Tennant's Scrooge is central to the show's narrative, leading his family on numerous quests that span the globe. He is depicted as a seasoned adventurer with a wealth of experience and knowledge, yet he also shows vulnerability, particularly in his relationships with his nephews Huey, Dewey, and Louie, and their friend Webby Vanderquack. Scrooge's journey is not just about finding treasures but also about rediscovering the importance of family, loyalty, and courage.

Originally introduced as a somewhat secondary character in the 1987 series, Webby receives a significant expansion in the reboot, becoming a more prominent and dynamic figure in the storyline.

        Webby is the granddaughter of Bentina Beakley, Scrooge McDuck's housekeeper and personal bodyguard. Raised in McDuck Manor, Webby grows up hearing stories about Scrooge's past adventures, fueling her fascination with adventure and mystery. Unlike her earlier portrayal as a sweet and somewhat timid girl, the reboot reimagines Webby as a bold and capable young duck who is highly skilled in combat, knowledgeable about history and lore, and eager to prove herself.
        
        Micucci's performance brings a blend of quirky charm and heartfelt sincerity to Webby, making her an endearing and relatable character. Her energetic and sometimes socially awkward demeanor adds a unique layer to the character, while her bravery and resourcefulness make her an essential member of the team. Webby's relationship with the triplets—Huey, Dewey, and Louie—evolves throughout the series, as she becomes not just their friend but also a fellow adventurer, often leading the way with her quick thinking and determination.
        
        Webby's character arc includes exploring her own identity and uncovering secrets about her family's past, adding depth to her role in the series.

      <h1>voice actor: Dani Pudi</h1>
        <p>In the 2017 reboot of "DuckTales," Danny Pudi voices the character Huey Duck, one of Scrooge McDuck's adventurous grandnephews. Huey, whose full name is Hubert Duck, is the eldest of the triplets and is characterized by his red attire and cap. He is often depicted as the most responsible and level-headed of the trio, embodying traits such as diligence, intelligence, and a penchant for organization.

            Pudi, best known for his role as Abed Nadir on "Community," brings a unique charm and warmth to Huey's character. His voice work captures Huey's curiosity and enthusiasm for adventure while also highlighting his cautious and methodical nature. Huey is often seen with his Junior Woodchuck Guidebook, a comprehensive manual that he relies on for information and guidance during their adventures.
            
            In the reboot, Huey's personality is fleshed out more deeply compared to earlier portrayals. He is portrayed as the quintessential "big brother," often taking on a protective role and striving to maintain order among his siblings, Dewey and Louie. Despite his serious demeanor, Huey is also shown to have a deep sense of wonder and a love for learning, which makes him a key player in solving the mysteries and challenges the group encounters.
            
            Danny Pudi's performance as Huey brings a perfect balance of earnestness and humor to the character, making him relatable and endearing to audiences. Huey's interactions with his family, particularly his relationship with his brothers and his great-uncle Scrooge, form a core part of the show's emotional and narrative depth.
