  <p>The 2017 reboot of "DuckTales" is a modern animated series produced by Disney Television Animation. It is a revival of the beloved 1987 series of the same name, which was itself based on the classic "Uncle Scrooge" comics by Carl Barks. The reboot captures the spirit of adventure, humor, and family dynamics that made the original series a hit while updating it for a new generation of viewers.

    The show centers around the adventures of Scrooge McDuck, the world's richest duck, and his mischievous grandnephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie. After being estranged for ten years, Scrooge reunites with his nephews and, along with their friend Webby Vanderquack, embarks on a series of thrilling escapades. These adventures take them around the world in search of treasure and uncovering secrets, often pitting them against a rogues' gallery of villains, including the cunning Flintheart Glomgold, the witchy Magica De Spell, and the Beagle Boys.
    
    The 2017 reboot features a stellar voice cast, including David Tennant as Scrooge McDuck, Danny Pudi as Huey, Ben Schwartz as Dewey, Bobby Moynihan as Louie, and Kate Micucci as Webby. The show has been praised for its sharp writing, rich character development, and its ability to balance nostalgia with fresh storytelling. The animation style pays homage to the original series while incorporating modern techniques, giving it a vibrant and dynamic look.
